## About us

We are the programming club of [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) & [IMT-Business School](https://www.imt-bs.eu/), under the parent network association [MiNET](https://www.minet.net/fr/). We promote sharing and having fun with code and better code.

## About this website

This is the front page for our Github organization, the favorite place to publish short articles about our activities and show what we do.

## About not us

We aren't [Code Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Club) project. It's super cool, they promote code and our names are close but it's the only thing that brings us together.
