# About the project

As you can see, there is something new under the hood : ***THE*** Club Code website.
It may seem strange to you but Club Code hasn't made a website to represent it for years (well, I think there was a project to do so, years ago). You're going to ask me why, well because it's not necessarily necessary and the "static" web is not very exciting.

## So why did you decide to do it now.

Let's just say that Club Code's Github has been getting more and more projects and that it would be good time to build on that to easily present it to the next 1A (first years students).

## How long will it take to set up it ?

I don't know but it will take weeks to completely add all the content we want to show.
